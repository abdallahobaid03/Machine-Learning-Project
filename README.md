# Machine-Learning-Project
Machine learning project for room occupancy detection using sensor data. Implements Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting with Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning. Preprocessing includes feature engineering, SMOTE, and scaling. Evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and validation accuracy.
